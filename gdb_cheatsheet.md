# GDB Hooks

## hooks are user defined commands , when there is command 'temp' , whenever the command is executed , if there is any hook named 'hook-temp' then commands in that hook will gets executed 

## let's say if my program stops then some commands should execute 

## show registers automatically when program stops

```
(gdb) define hook-stop
> info registers
> x/8cb $esp
> end
```



# Continue only the Function

```
(gdb) fin
```


# Quit the gdb

```
(gdb) quit 
```

# Installing PEDA Plugin

## peda plugin is like automated hook that displays registers , stack and instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/longld/peda.git ~/peda
echo "source ~/peda/peda.py" >> ~/.gdbinit
```

## for other peda commands check out its github
